Hi! This is some of my work where I extracted certain data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Papagoat/brain-assessment/main/restaurant_data.json. 

1. First download the .ipynb file  from this repository and open it in Jupyter notebook.
2. Run all cells of the code to see the output. The code is written in Python language using Jupyter notebook.
3. Install necessary libraries by running the first cell, and import the required packages by running the second cell.
4. Some code has been included to understand the structure of the data better, but commented out as it is not part of the required functions. 
5. Run the cells in order to get the required results.
